# ilex-lang README

Ilex is a high-level statically (TODO) typed programming language. It has a familiar c++/go/typescript-like syntax with inspiration from other languages such as Python and Ruby.

The main goal of Ilex is to be easy to use and make development quicker. Ilex strives for adequacy and will settle for nothing less (eventually).

See https://atsoteck.github.io/ilex-lang/ for more info.
